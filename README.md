# generateurQuestions
This project is an open-ended question generator for educational use.

The teacher first imports a course material (such as these slides from his latest lecture). The software then proposes various open-ended questions on the course content, following a standard template. Once the questions have been validated by the teacher, the software writes the answers to the questions. The teacher validates or edits the answers. At the end, the teacher can export everything in Moodle open questions or JSON format.

Uses GPT-3.5. Requires an API key (to be written in the scripts/generationQR.js file).

Question templates are :
What does ... mean? ?
What causes ...? ?
Describe ... in your own words.
Explain why ... .
How might ... affect ... ?
Give a new example of ... ?
How would you use ... to ... ?
What do you think would happen if ... ?
How might ... affect ... ?
